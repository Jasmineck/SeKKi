## Why would you need seKKi?
SeKKi is an intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) or intelligent personal assistant (IPA) is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions. Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal (spoken?) commands. A similar concept, however with differences, lays under the dialogue systems.The capabilities and usage of virtual assistants are expanding rapidly, with new products entering the market and a strong emphasis on both email and voice user interfaces.

## What would you learn from this Project?
Since we know  Apple and Google have large installed bases of users on smartphones. Microsoft has a large installed base of Windows-based personal computers, smartphones and smart speakers. Amazon has a large install base for smart speakers. Conversica has over 100 million engagements via its email and sms interface Intelligent Virtual Assistants for business. So, why not we create a friend for ourselfs since the merits of having a personalised voice operated assistant is unbounded.

## Issues with Sekki :

1. Commands may sometimes be difficult for sekki to understand.
2. Sekki is personalised for the owner so the collaborators have to edit the source code to fully utilize seKKi.
3. Assignment and To-do list functions does not work as expected.
